The core mission of the center is to address the increasingly severe challenges of global climate change, particularly the profound impacts of extreme weather events such as droughts and heatwaves on human society.<br><br>\n\n                    The Sixth Assessment Report of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) clearly states that global warming will lead to more frequent and severe drought events. It is projected that by 2050, over 5 billion people worldwide will face water scarcity. As a high-risk region for climate change, Taiwan has deeply experienced this trend in recent years: the century's worst drought in 2021 caused a nationwide water supply crisis with economic losses exceeding one hundred billion NT dollars; in 2023, consecutive record-breaking extreme high-temperature events not only impacted the energy system but also directly threatened public health and quality of life.<br><br>\n\n                    In the face of these unprecedented challenges, the efforts of a single country or institution are no longer sufficient. The international scientific community widely recognizes that only through cross-border, interdisciplinary collaborative research and knowledge sharing can effective solutions be developed. TGDIRC was established against this backdrop, committed to creating an integrated international research platform.<br><br>\n\n                    Since its inception, TGDIRC has actively established cooperative relationships with leading international institutions such as the National Drought Mitigation Center (NDMC) in the United States, the Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation (CSIRO) in Australia, and the European Climate Adaptation Platform (Climate-ADAPT). It also participates in initiatives led by The United Nations Office for Disaster Risk Reduction (UNDRR) and the World Meteorological Organization (WMO). Concurrently, the center has built research partnerships with countries in the Asia-Pacific region facing similar challenges, including Japan, South Korea, Australia, India, and Vietnam.<br><br>\n\n                    To establish a permanent platform for international academic exchange and policy dialogue, and to gather the wisdom of top global experts in the fields of climate extremes, societal resilience, and human livability, TGDIRC has organized the inaugural \"International Forum on Climate Extremes and Societal Resilience.\" This forum aims to become a major annual event in the field of climate science in the Asia-Pacific region and globally, establishing a long-term mechanism to promote international cooperation, foster knowledge innovation, and strengthen the scientific basis for policymaking.<br><br>\n\n                    Through this forum, we hope not only to showcase Taiwan's strength and international contributions in climate science research but also to provide innovative solutions for the global community to address climate change challenges, working together to preserve a livable environment for humanity in a warming world.\n                    </p>\n                    "},{title:"Objectives",content:"<p>\n                    This forum is dedicated to developing the world's most influential exchange platform for research on climate extremes and societal resilience, bringing together top interdisciplinary experts to provide innovative solutions for humanity's sustainable survival in a warming world. The conference will be held in person to emphasize deep face-to-face communication and the development of collaborative networks.
