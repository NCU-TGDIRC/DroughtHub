        "content": "<p>The Taiwan and Global Drought Information and Research Center (TGDIRC / DroughtHub), established in 2024 and led by the Center for Space and Remote Sensing Research at National Central University, is dedicated to integrating research and development for global drought monitoring, early warning systems, and adaptation strategies. The core mission of the center is to address the increasingly severe challenges of global climate change, particularly the profound impacts of extreme climate events like droughts and heat stress on human society.</p><p>The Sixth Assessment Report of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) clearly states that global warming will lead to more frequent and severe drought events. It is projected that by 2050, over 5 billion people worldwide will face water shortages. As a high-risk region for climate change, Taiwan has deeply experienced this trend in recent years: the centennial drought in 2021 caused a nationwide water supply crisis with economic losses exceeding NT$100 billion; the record-breaking extreme heat events in 2023 not only impacted the energy system but also directly threatened public health and quality of life.</p><p>In the face of these unprecedented challenges, the efforts of a single country or institution are no longer sufficient. The international scientific community widely recognizes that only through cross-border, interdisciplinary collaborative research and knowledge sharing can effective solutions be developed. TGDIRC was established against this backdrop, aiming to build an integrated international research platform.</p><p>Since its inception, TGDIRC has actively established cooperative relationships with top international institutions such as the National Drought Mitigation Center (NDMC) in the United States, the Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation (CSIRO) in Australia, and the European Climate Adaptation Platform. It also participates in relevant initiatives from the United Nations Office for Disaster Risk Reduction (UNDRR) and the World Meteorological Organization (WMO). At the same time, the center has established research partnerships with countries in the Asia-Pacific region facing similar challenges, including Japan, South Korea, Australia, India, and Vietnam.</p><p>To establish a permanent international academic exchange and policy dialogue platform that gathers the wisdom of top global experts in climate extremes, societal resilience, and human livability, TGDIRC has specially planned the first “International Forum on Climate Extremes and Societal Resilience.” This forum aims to become a major annual event in the field of climate science in the Asia-Pacific region and globally, establishing a long-term mechanism for promoting international cooperation, fostering knowledge innovation, and strengthening the scientific basis for policymaking.</p><p>Through this forum, we hope not only to showcase Taiwan's strength and international contributions in the field of climate science research but also to provide innovative solutions for the global community to face the challenges of climate change, working together to maintain a livable environment for humanity in a warming world."

      {
        "title": "Objectives",
        "content": "<p>This forum is committed to developing the world's most influential research exchange platform on climate extremes and societal resilience, bringing together top interdisciplinary expert wisdom to provide innovative solutions for human sustainability in a warming world. The conference will be held in-person, emphasizing deep face-to-face exchanges and the development of collaborative networks. Paper submissions will use an English abstract system to ensure a high degree of integration in international academic exchange.</p><p>The forum focuses on core issues such as drought monitoring and early warning, health impacts of heat stress, water resource security, agricultural resilience, ecosystem adaptation, energy system stability, urban climate governance, and disaster risk management, aiming to establish a complete knowledge chain from scientific research to policy implementation. Based on TGDIRC's founding mission to \"promote global climate resilience and safeguard a livable future for humanity,\" this forum has the following strategic objectives and core values:</p><ol><li><b>Leading Global Climate Science</b><br>Special emphasis is placed on integrating cutting-edge technologies like artificial intelligence, satellite remote sensing, and big data analytics to establish a next-generation, long-term, and real-time climate monitoring and early warning system. We invite top global scientists to jointly explore the theoretical and practical optimization of these systems. By promoting forward-looking practical technology applications and deep dialogue with theory, we aim to set a new benchmark for global research on climate extremes, transitioning from a follower to a leader in scientific innovation. We will shift from responding to challenges to predicting them and establishing diverse solutions.</li><li><b>Building an International Scientific Research Ecosystem</b><br>Taiwan holds a unique geographical and research advantage in climate studies. This forum will connect with the international academic community to establish interdisciplinary strategic partnerships, making Taiwan a hub for climate science in the Asia-Pacific region. Through the TGDIRC platform, we will deepen strategic partnerships with top research institutions in the US, Europe, and Australia, establish a permanent global expert network, promote long-term research cooperation, and encourage dialogue between young scholars and the international community. The goal is to shape Taiwan into a bridge for knowledge and policy exchange in global climate governance and to enhance Taiwan's voice and influence on international climate governance issues.</li><li><b>Enhancing National Climate Resilience</b><br>Establish a complete transformation mechanism from \"science → policy → practice,\" effectively translating scientific results into practical policy recommendations and assisting the government in implementing them in society and industry. Provide the government with forward-looking climate adaptation strategies, shifting from reactive responses to proactive prevention. When future climate change disasters occur, Taiwan can transform from being merely a victim to a solution provider, becoming a model case for global climate resilience governance.</li><li><b>Promoting the Realization of Sustainable Development Goals</b><br>Closely align with the UN 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development, particularly addressing SDG 6 (Clean Water and Sanitation), SDG 11 (Sustainable Cities and Communities), SDG 13 (Climate Action), and SDG 15 (Life on Land). Propose breakthrough solutions in areas such as water resources, urban resilience, climate change response, and environmental protection to ensure that the conference outcomes have a substantial impact on the sustainable development agenda and demonstrate Taiwan's tangible contribution to global sustainable development.</li><li><b>Catalyzing Interdisciplinary Innovation and Integration</b><br>Solving climate challenges relies not only on in-depth exploration within a single discipline. By breaking traditional disciplinary boundaries, we will promote deep integration between climate science, public health, sociology, economics, and engineering technology. We will cultivate a new generation of climate experts with systemic thinking, foster new frontiers of research knowledge and innovative policy strategic frameworks, and drive solutions from single-point breakthroughs to systemic innovation.</li><li><b>Establishing a Global Knowledge Sharing Mechanism</b><br>Create an open international research platform to incentivize cross-national research team exchanges and collaboration. Promote data sharing, technology transfer, and talent exchange to ensure that climate science research results can be rapidly transformed into global public welfare, allowing scientific knowledge to truly serve the construction of a community with a shared future for mankind.</li></ol>"

As extreme climate change leads to drastic environmental shifts, the frequency and intensity of drought events are gradually increasing. Establishing systematic and scientific drought monitoring and early warning technologies has become an urgent international research and policy need. This theme will focus on the integration and application of multi-source data, including satellite monitoring, ground observation networks, and climate change simulations, to enhance real-time monitoring and prediction capabilities of the drought development process.<br>Topics will include, but are not limited to:<br>1. Innovative applications of monitoring technologies<br>2. Design, comparison, and improvement of drought indices<br>3. Application of AI and big data analytics in drought monitoring and early warning<br>4. Establishment of cross-regional drought monitoring platforms and decision support systems<br>5. Methods for assessing drought impacts on agriculture and ecosystems<br>6. Climate model simulation and drought event prediction</p></li><li class=\"accent-box\"><h4>Theme 2: Urban Heat Island Effect and Climate Adaptation</h4><p>Rapid urbanization and intensifying global warming have made the Urban Heat Island (UHI) effect a major challenge for densely populated areas, as it exacerbates energy demand, strains infrastructure, and affects residents' health and social safety. This theme focuses on the causes of the UHI effect, monitoring technologies, and multi-level adaptation strategies, aiming to establish a comprehensive response that integrates scientific foundations, engineering techniques, and social governance.<br>Topics will include, but are not limited to:<br>1. Mechanisms and driving factors of the UHI effect<br>2. Application of digital technologies in urban heat monitoring<br>3. Urban climate simulation and heatwave impact prediction models<br>4. The role of smart city technologies in cooling and energy conservation<br>5. Effectiveness evaluation of urban renewal and land use planning in mitigating the UHI effect<br>6. Sustainable development through the combination of digital technology and green architecture</p></li><li class=\"accent-box\"><h4>Theme 3: Climate Policy, Water Resource Management, and Societal Resilience</h4><p>Climate change is drastically affecting the stability of the water cycle system, with water resource issues becoming increasingly severe due to droughts, floods, and environmental pollution. How to enhance societal resilience and adaptability through forward-looking climate policies and effective water resource management has become a crucial issue for all nations. This theme will focus on interdisciplinary governance and collaboration among multiple stakeholders, addressing policy, management, and social innovation to establish a fair and sustainable water resource governance framework.<br>Topics will include, but are not limited to:<br>1. Water resource governance policies and institutional design under climate change; interdisciplinary resilience integrating hydrology, public policy, economics, and sociology<br>2. Cooperative mechanisms for trans-basin or transnational water resource management<br>3. Application of smart water grids, IoT, and AI in water resource regulation<br>4. Adaptation strategies involving groundwater development, reclaimed water use, and non-conventional water resources<br>5. Water resource risk management and social equity<br>6. Resilience assessment and decision support methods for water resources in the face of extreme droughts and floods</p></li><li class=\"accent-box\"><h4>Theme 4: Health Impacts of Climate Change</h4><p>Climate change has become one of the most severe public health challenges of the 21st century. Extreme heat, droughts, water shortages, and other extreme weather events are directly or indirectly threatening human health and social development. Climate impacts lead to issues such as heatstroke, cardiovascular diseases, the spread of infectious diseases, and deteriorating food and nutrition security, exacerbating health inequalities and placing vulnerable populations at higher risk, which can cause potential fluctuations and impacts on social stability. This theme focuses on scientific research, health risk assessment, and policy implementation, soliciting interdisciplinary research findings and case studies to promote the development of health-oriented climate adaptation strategies.<br>Topics will include, but are not limited to:<br>1. Impact assessment of high temperatures and heatwaves on cardiovascular and respiratory diseases<br>2. Climate change and the epidemiology of infectious diseases<br>3. Research on mental health and social stress under climate impacts<br>4. Building the climate resilience of healthcare systems<br>5. The relationship between climate change and public health management risks<br>6. Application of protective measures for vulnerable populations' health</p></li><li class=\"accent-box\"><h4>Theme 5: Economic Impact Assessment of Extreme Climate Events</h4><p>Extreme climate events such as droughts, floods, heatwaves, and hurricanes not only cause direct damage to infrastructure and production systems but also have profound economic impacts through supply chain disruptions, energy price volatility, labor losses, and rising insurance costs. Quantifying and assessing these impacts, and further proposing specific financial, policy, and market response measures, is a crucial foundation for enhancing societal resilience. This thematic session focuses on the economic risk assessment and adaptation strategies for diverse industries, production supply chains, and market environments under extreme climate conditions.<br>Topics will include, but are not limited to:<br>1. Disaster risk models, actuarial science, and reinsurance mechanism design<br>2. The impact of climate events on energy markets, agricultural output, and supply chains<br>3. Economic risk assessment within the ESG framework<br>4. Economic vulnerability and adaptation strategies for SMEs and local communities facing extreme climate events<br>5. The impact of climate migration and population displacement on labor markets and local economies<br>6. Resilience and recovery of urban, community, or market environments under climate impacts</p></li></ul>"
